# How I Used AI for this Project 

(I have Attached the AI Logs I had during the making of this project) 

I used ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas and help clear my mind regarding my doubts i had 
- it suggested some db designs and how the workflow can be done
- gave ideas for making api endpoints 
- It generated a realistic dummy data for database
- pointed out few edge cases which might affect the workflow 

I used Cursor to help with the coding related part 
- making the API
- testing the API functionality
- creating a simple ui for this project 

Where I Deviated from AI
- I created databse with reference to ai suggested schema
- I added the created by in table rather than making separate admins table 
- Tested using Postman 
- Did a lot of prompting to get the desired output
